# Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Prediction and Classification - CNN
Group 1: Rayna Liu, Zheyue Wang
## Introduction
In recent years, the extraction of age, gender, and ethnicity from facial images has
been widely used in many applications, including biometrics, security controls, and
entertainment. Convolutional Neural Network has achieved remarkable success in
face recognition, image classification, and object recognition. This final project uses
the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on face recognition tasks for age estimation
and ethnicity and gender classification. 

## Table of Contents:
Our repoistory contain 4 folder:
* **Group-Proposal**
  * *Group Proposal.pdf* -- describe our plan for the final project
* **Final-Group-Project-Report**
  * *Final Group Project Report* -- final report
  * *Final Group Project Appendix*
* **Final-Group-Presentation**
  * *Final Group Preesentation.pdf* -- the powerpoint of our group presentation
* **Code**
  * *Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py* -- training file, predict and analysis based on the trained models
  * *Reload_Model_for_Analysis.py* -- predict and analysis based on the best models
 * **zheyue-wang-individual-project**
   * *Code*  -- individual work code
   * *zheyue-wang-final-project-report*   -- individual report

## How It Works
 1. Read the README.md in the Code folder before run Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py file.
 2. Run Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py file.
 3. Run Reload_Model_for_Analysis.py file.
 4. Compare the result to the final report.
 5. Look at the powerpoint in Final Group Preesentation.pdf.

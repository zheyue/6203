# Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Prediction and Classification - CNN
Group 1: Rayna Liu, Zheyue Wang
## Introduction
In recent years, the extraction of age, gender, and ethnicity from facial images has
been widely used in many applications, including biometrics, security controls, and
entertainment. Convolutional Neural Network has achieved remarkable success in
face recognition, image classification, and object recognition. This final project uses
the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on face recognition tasks for age estimation
and ethnicity and gender classification. 

## Structure of repoistory:
our repoistory contain 4 folder, which are : Group-Proposal, Final-Group-Project-Report, Final-Group-Presentation, and Code.
Group-Proposal folder contains Group Proposal.pdf that basically describe our plan for this project.
Final-Group-Project-Report folder contains our final report for this project.
Final-Group-Presentation folder contains the Final Group Preesentation.pdf, which is the powerpoint of our group presentation.
Code folder contains Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py file, which mainly use for training our model.

## How It Works
 1. Download the age_gender.csv from code folder of from [AGE, GENDER AND ETHNICITY (FACE DATA) CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv)
 2. Run Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py file.
 3. Compare the result to the final report 
 4. Look at the powerpoint in Final Group Preesentation.pdf

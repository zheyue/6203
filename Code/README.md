# Order for Works
I. This Code folder contains a python file Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py, which mainly use for training our model and generating the prediction.

II. Before run the Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py, you should download two things:

> a. Download age_gender.csv from [Kaggle:AGE, GENDER AND ETHNICITY (FACE DATA) CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/nipunarora8/age-gender-and-ethnicity-face-data-csv), which it's our dataset that used for training model.

> b. Download the whole Test_Images folder, it contains 6 images from Google Image that used for test our model outside the given dataset.

III. Since the models generated in the Final_Project_Age_Ethnicity_Gender_Model.py would not be the best model, it would be get the better result if you download the best models. Follow the below instructure to download the best models.

# Download the Best Models
I. Best Age model download [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nv94cyZDb4TR5Rs7PmUNKLdUvZIWEMCO/view?usp=sharing).

II. Best Ethnicity & Gender Model download [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10UHjQKyQBq9tWywoapzuse_qk4O8ienv/view?usp=sharing).

III. Save above two best models, run the Reload_Model_for_Analysis.py to generate the best age estimator and ethnicity and gender classification.
